- embedding service for directories, possibly tied to "box"
- visual format bug in textsel with format codes
- cursor highlight retained on screen when in selection mode
- something isn't working when adding RAG results to thread
  - maybe reimplement using vector store by saving all conversations as
    markdown files and then uploading them
